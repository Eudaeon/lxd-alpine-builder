# LXD Alpine Linux image builder

This is a fixed version of [saghul's LXD Alpine Linux image builder](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder). It applies the fix [suggested here](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder/issues/10#issuecomment-2614157925): changing the checksum verification with the filename instead of the filepath.
